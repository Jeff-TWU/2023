Building on this background work, we explore the values and attitudes of the academics who undertake open textbook production with student co- creators. Student inclusion is lauded in research as essential for student belonging, but little work has been done to look for the challenges involved when traditional power dynamics are disrupted. In this research, we describe a potential nexus of three complementary components: open textbooks, social justice, and students as partners. We investigate the affordances of the open textbook to facilitate change in the power dynamics of content production as well as in classroom practice. Session Link {++link++} Sarah Eaton University of Calgary Monday, May 29, 11:00 AM Academic Integrity in the Age of Artificial Intelligence How worried do we need to be that students are going to cheat more because of artificial intelligence? Does writing generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) writing app constitute plagiarism? How can artificial intelligence be used ethically for teaching, learning, and assessment? Will a robot take my job? These questions have dominated teaching and learning circles and social media since late 2022 when ChatGPT emerged. In this Keynote, Sarah provides insights into how AI tools are impacting higher education. She will share insights from recent research project at the University of Calgary that explores the question: What are the ethical implications of artificial intelligence technologies for teaching, learning, and assessment?
